- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @scholtde, weird I know but it has been my username since I worked my first job.
- Iâ€™ have a passion for all things related to AI, IoT and robotics, but I also hope to take on things related to crypto and web3 world soon.
- I'm the author and creator of edgE:Tower. E:T allows me to express my innovative ideas and I get to puzzle things together in which I have an interest.
